terminal needs to create a pseudo terminal which is basically two fds
-a parent
-a child

then it needs to fork a child process and launch a shell in it

//this can either be achieved with openpty and execve or forkpty

the terminal emulator will then get the user input via x11 events, pass it to the child fd
the child process (most certainly a shell) will use it and output something
the emulator will draw according to that output


backspace might be shitty and cause segfaults at the moment
